# AngularSandbox

This is my Angular Sandbox. Each branch is an exploration project for learning how to implement various features with Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

## Starting a New Branch

After checking out the new branch, run $ `git reset --hard starter-bootstrap` to delete the history or $ `git revert starter-bootstrap` to add a commit which returns the project to its initial state with Bootstrap styles included.

A commit tagged `starter-bootstrap` may be used to start from the boilerplate produced by starting a project with Angular CLI. The app template and component have been cleared of the boilerplate details. Bootstrap CSS has been added as a dependency and included in the styles defined in `angular.json`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help
